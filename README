This is the code following Sentdex's Data Analysis with Python and Pandas tutorial.
Code has been updated to account for changes to different libraries in 2019.

Methods were modified to output to pickles so an API call to Quandl did not need to be made every time a file was ran.
The functions were left in the code commented out in case updated data is needed.
